For this challenge I decided to use the LinkedList data structure repersentation for the problem at hand. The indidvidual prodcuts on 
the market and that are available for purchase are the Nodes and the intialization class for this is called Product. 
The list is called Market which incorporates these Nodes. When calling Market class in main it initializes a list based on input and then proceedes to construct prodcuts of the users choice to put on the market by asking for the title, price and number of items that are in inventory. I could have added many more functions for access and manipulation simply because of using this data structure. It makes many tasks simple making even the bonus questions easy for this problem. To solve the bonus I would have just created a very similar LinkedList in another class to hold information from the Market List whenver the user would have wanted to make a purchase. By checking if user has enough money, and inventory was enough, it would allow this and correspondingly update the respective fields that would be affected.
